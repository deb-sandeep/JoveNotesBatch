JoveNotesBatch is installed as a system service which will be started at
boot after mysql.service has been started.

Why not @reboot?

@reboot is grossly unreliable and lacks the added advantage of the systemctl
interface.

Steps to install JNBatch as a system service

1. Link the jnbatch.service file as a system service file

cd ~/etc/systemd/system
sudo ln -s /home/sandeep/projects/bin/jnbatch/jnbatch.service jnbatch.service

2. Verify the link exists

3. Reload the systemctl daemon

systemctl daemon-reload

4. Enable jnbatch service

systemctl enable jnbatch.service

5. Confirm that the service was created successfully

systemctl --all | grep jnbatch.service

6. Start the service

systemctl start jnbatch.service


NOTE: The production config file needs to have the passwords and keys
in the configuration. It doesn't pick up the values from environment.
